         <h3>HELPING TIGER POPULATION THRIVE </h3>
            <p>It speaks to the power of the mighty predator that the first-ever global summit a single species brought together world leaders
			to commit to a single purpose-doubling the number of wild tigers by 2026. Wildlife conservation program is a pivotal role in realizing
			this ambitious goal,which will ensure the king of the jungle will once again thrive across its range in 13 to 20 countries to benefit
			other wildlife and wild spaces,secure freshwater sources and a future for people too.</p>

            <p>A critically endangered population of the mekong River's dophins became the face of a global campaign to stop a major dam
			that would also impact local communities and livelihoods. The connection to the "smiling face of the Mekong" influenced more
			than a qurter of a million people around the world to WWF in saying no to the Don sahon dam. This species continue to inspire
			people to reduce population of freshwater sources, improve fishing practices and encourage only sustainable hydropower development.</p>

			They are reigning celebrieties in the in the  handful of Zoos around the world where people flock to see them. Numbering

           <h3>what is widelife conservation and why it matter to us as humanity?</h3>
            <p>widelife conservation is the practice of protecting endangered plants and animals species and their habitants.</p>
             <span style="color:9ACD32; font-weight:default">CONSERVATION BIOLOGY BUT WHAT'S THAT? 
		     <summary>conservation biology is the branche of biology that deals with the effects of humans on the environment,and with the conservation of biodiversity.</summary></span>
		     <details>
			 <P>
		     We all contribute to these threat in some form or another, even if we don't intend to, that's fine.<span style="color:blue; font-weight:default;"> Conservation does involve everyone.</span>
		    <span style="color:maroon;font-weight:default;">Understand why others might not be the same,without the natural world, we simply wouldn't exist. </span>Every human need links back to the natural world not obliged. The natural world is incredible to protect and respect.<span style="color:navy;font-weight:default;"> If we put pressure on our biodiversity, then
		    us as human will have to deal with just as many negative consequences as the widelife itself.</span>

				 <summary>Enact  urgent  International  law | stop  poaching </summary>
			    <p>Despite increased efforts to tackle the surge in poaching, nearly 110,000 elephants have been
				killed in the last 10 years—highlighting the need for urgent international action to address the
				crisis.African and Asian countries are reeling under a poaching crisis. Ruthless criminal networks
				are plundering the wild to supply skyrocketing demand for elephant trunks, illegal ivory and tiger parts.
				</p>
			   <p> As a WWF supporter, you know that wild-life crime is the most immediate threat to wild elephants,
			    tigers and rhinos. And you share our concern about its connection to regional conflicts, national
			    security and even terrorism.Thailand and the U.S.—to strengthen law enforcement, invest in more boots
				on the ground and commit to long-term demand reduction efforts. But we also need your support to stop
				demand for illegal wildlife parts and products. Pledge to stop wildlife crime and commit to preserving
				nature's beauty for future generations.</p>
