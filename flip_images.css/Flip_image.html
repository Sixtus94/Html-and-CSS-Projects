             <h1>Flipping an Image Element</h1>
             <p>We can flip the img element using the CSS transform property. We can do so using the scaleX and scaleY transforms.</p>

        <img src="./images/rose.jpg" alt="" />
        
           <h1>Alternatively you can use rotateX and rotateY</h1>
           <p>Note that I’ve added a slight perspective to the transform chain. Without the perspective transform the rotateY animation would be just as flat as the scaleX animation. I’ve added it to the scaleX animation as well to show that it doesn’t make a difference.</p>

           <h1>Flipping a Background Image</h1>

           <p>The only way (at this point in time) (and as far as I can tell) to flip a background-image is to flip the element containing the background image. But that would flip its contents as well.</p>

           <p class="rose">
            Tulips form a genus of spring-blooming perennial herbaceous bulbiferous
            geophytes.</p>


            <P>To work around this we can either move the background to a separate element or create a pseudo-element.</P>

          <p>To go with pseudo-element.</p>
