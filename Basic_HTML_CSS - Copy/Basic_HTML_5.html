	<p>Html entity are characters sequence placed in the text
	   of an html document to print out reserved characters which
       may otherwise be interpreted as html code by a browser, or other 
       characters that would be difficult to generate with a typeical keyboard.</p>
    <p>Why entity are used in HTML? This is because, some characters are reserved
       in html . If less than (<) or greater than (>) signs are used in html text,
       the browser might mix them with tags. Entity names or Entity numbers can be
       used to display reserved html characters</p>
